        lamps on and off.

        This sequence will place the camera in the mode best able to handle
        fast back-to-back image acquisitions with illumination and
        exposure-time changes in between each: rolling-shutter overlap
        external-exposure mode, where the IOTool box will send signals to tell
        the camera how long to expose for. The IOTool box will trigger start
        the exposure and wait for all of the image rows to start exposing (10
        or 27 ms, depending on readout rate, and signaled by the FireAll output
        from the camera going high). Once all rows are exposing, IOTool will
        turn on the desired lamps for the correct exposure time. Finally,
        IOTool will turn off the lamps and trigger the start of the next
        exposure. Because overlap mode is used, the sensor rows "roll off"
        after the acquisition at the same time as the rows "roll on" for the
        next acquisition. Thus, the "dead time" between frames is just a single
        frame-read time, which is the absolute minimum obtainable, especially
        in a mode where the exposure time can be set to any value at all.

        Note that for each image, the total exposure time will be the given
        exposure time plus the frame read time, though the lights will only be
        on for the given exposure time. Thus if correcting for dark currents,
        the former total exposure time should be used.

        Keyword Parameters: intensity values for the Spectra X lamps, if they
            are not to be used at full intensity. Any lamps not named will be
            set to full intensity.
